				<h3>UMBC Welcome Week 2014</h3>
				<p> As Vice President of Design & Marketing for UMBC’s Student Events Board, I was asked to create the visual identity and logo design for UMBC’s 2014 Welcome Week. This entailed designing their informational booklet which was given to thousands of incoming students. In addition to this, I created T-Shirt designs that were handed out to hundreds of Student Life staff and students. Finally, I created multiple posters that showcased the events happening that week, which were posted all across campus.<br><br> The outdoor movie being shown this year was a super-hero movie, which helped to shape my comic-book inspired design and gave me the idea for the super-hero UMBC retriever.

				<h3>UMBC Homecoming 2014</h3>
				<p>As Vice President of Design & Marketing for UMBC’s Student Events Board, I was asked to design the university’s 2014 Homecoming Logo. This logo was used all across campus on multiple different platforms and by all forms of staff and administration. I specifically used this logo in creating the Homecoming 2014 T-Shirts that were handed out to thousands of UMBC students. In addition to this, the logo was used to create screen-printed spirt posters for Homecoming. 
	<br><br>My inspiration for this design comes from my minimalist aesthetic. While looking at past logos, I felt a strong need to simplify and create a design that would be classic and timeless. I chose a simple crest and combined bold block-letters with a vintage-style script for a modern yet retro look.

				<h3>Restaurant Slang from A to Z</h3>
				<p>For Typography II, I was asked to create a series of 26 alphabetical flash cards to inform readers of a set of vocabulary words for a specific occupation. Having worked in the restaurant industry for a number of years, I naturally chose restaurant slang. This vernacular is something I have a clear understanding of, which allowed me to create a design that was true to its nature.
                     <br><br>I used both color and icons to distinguish between language that was used by different staff within the restaurant industry. The type choices and design are inspired by the trendy, hip new Upscale American restaurants that I have noticed gaining popularity in the past decade. I chose an all sans-serif type combination with contrasting x-heights and weights to create a look that felt clean, effortless, and quite simply, cool.

				<h3>La Comida: A Spanish Cook Book</h3>
				<p>For Typography II, I was asked to create a cookbook that was specific to a particular geographical region or culture and select a series of recipes based on my choice of theme. Having taking Spanish all throughout my grade-school years, I chose to create a Spanish cookbook taking recipes from all regions across the country. 
	<br><br>I took notes from the Spanish traditional dress and their national flag for my inspiration of color and pattern choice. This allowed me to create a cookbook that was bright, festive, and representative of the culture while also giving me the freedom to create a design that was clean and simple. 
	<br><br>My type choices for this book are very deliberate and were picked for their elegant characteristics. The headlining typeface’s swirling terminals spoke to the floral patterns seen on traditional Spanish garb, while the use of a modern serif font for the sub-headings continued this feeling of gracefulness.

				<h3>What Works Studio</h3>
				<p>While interning with What Works Studio this past summer, I was informed that the studio was in the process of re-branding and designing a new logo for themselves. I was asked to create multiple versions of different logo ideas to present to them in hopes they would be able to roll with one of my ideas. The slides below show my two different mock-ups sent to my supervisor. The third shows the design hat was ultimately chosen to become What Work Studio’s new logo. 
                
	<br><br>Once their new logo was chosen, I was asked to create a number of different digital ads for their digital magazine and their social media platforms. The last slide below shows one version of those ads.
